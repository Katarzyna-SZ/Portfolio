<p align="justify"><b>"Change is the only constant..."</b> It is fascinating how a thought that originated in ancient history turns out to be even more relevant in a fast-paced world we live in. It can be overwhelming but also thrilling. With my inherent curiosity, I enthusiastically choose the second option, which led me to make a bold career shift into the field of software testing.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Why a software tester you may ask?</b> As someone with background in interior design, I believe that my skills are versatile enough to <b>seamlessly transition into software testing.</b> 
By applying set of skills I had used so far like <b>creativity, attention to detail, adaptability and communication skills</b>: from applying creativity to unique test scenarios and user experience perspective, analyzing requirements and documentation to embracing changes, adjusting testing strategies to match the evolving software.</p>

<p align="justify">Although I am a newbie to the IT world, <b>I've been proactive in learning</b> essential tools like; basics of software testing according to ISTQB Certification, Jira, Confluence, SQL, Postman, Testlink and qTest. My primary goal is to develop my repository showcasing examples of my work while being inspired by the community.</p>

<p align="justify">Oh,  and when I don't look for "problems", I try to solve them. Bouldering problems :) as I am an avid climber. <b>Welcome to my Junior Software Tester portfolio.</b></p>
